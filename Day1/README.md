## Thoughts

This day was quite straight forward, as most day 1's are.

## Total time spent

~8-10 minutes

### Part 1
#### Time spent: 3 minutes
Part 1 was very easy using python built in sort. I'm lazy to not write my own sorting
so good thing it's there. Simple arithmetic.

### Part 2
#### Time spent: 5 minutes
Part 2 was also quite straight forward, any time I see counting occurances I immediately
think dictionary and it worked out quite well.
