## Thoughts

## Total time spent: ~1 hr

### Part 1
#### Time spent: ~50 min
I started out trying to do this recursively, then iteratively, then back to recursively. This could be done with
a single recursive call if I had integrated the directional values like -1, 0, 1 into the calls, but instead I just
hardcoded the direction to make it easier in my head and had 8 recursive calls. idk its not clean but effectively the same

### Part 2
#### Time spent: ~10 min
This was super easy, just check for the A, then look at the surrounding characters. not much to it really
