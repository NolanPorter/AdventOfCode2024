## Thoughts

I hate regex, and also the wording on the second question was abiguous and led me down a rabbit hole
wasting like 10 minutes.

## Total time spent
~20 minutes

### Part 1
#### Time spent: 5 minutes
This was pretty straight forward regex matching.


### Part 2
#### Time spent: 15 minutes
This was also pretty straight forward regex matching. Got tripped up on some wording about the muls being valid at the beginning of the program. I thought that each line represented a program so I was resetting the mul to true on each line, rather than just at the very beginning. Oops...
