# AdventOfCode2024

I'm going to try my best to go as far as I can in Advent of Code 2024!


## Code file format
```
def part1() -> int:
    val = 0
    with open('input.txt') as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            val += 1
    return val

def part2() -> int:
    val = 0
    with open('input.txt') as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            val += 1
    return val


print(part1())
print(part2())
```
